We have SASSIJS!

Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets + In + JavaScript => SASSIJS

BREAK FREE FROM CSS!!!

You can now use SASS instead of CSS in your web pages.  For a full description of SASS, see the documentation here:
http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html but ignore the installation instructions.

== Usage

Very easy.  Just link add a script element pointing to the library, and a link element pointing to the sass template.  For example:

  <script src="./sassijs.js" type="text/javascript"></script> 
  <link href="./main.sass" type="text/sass" />

== Tests

Had to twist qUnit to get the testing framework that I wanted, because I needed to be able to run individual unit tests.  You can access the test suite at:

.../sassijs/test/index.html

== Status

This software is currently at version 0.437, which is alpha-quality.  When it hits 1.0, it will be feature complete with the SASS specifications that make sense outside of Ruby, and it will be cross-browser compatible up to jquery's standards.
